<h3><a name="ex1">Adirondacks</a></h3>

<p>Bohlen and Essene (1977) used two-oxide and two-feldspar thermometry to estimate maximum temperatures of (granulite-facies) metamorphism in the Adirondacks.  The two thermometers gave broadly comformable results, indicating peak temperatures near 800&deg;C.  Many rocks in the area contain relatively Fe-rich augite and Opx.  These pairs were not used in determining metamorphic temperatures, but they still provide useful constraints, for had the granulite-facies temperatures exceeded 808&deg;C, these pyroxenes would have reacted to form metamorphic pigeonites.  The absence of such pigeonites thus indirectly supports the maximum temperatures inferred from the oxides and feldspars.  Had the oxides and feldspars suggested temperatures above 808&deg;C, on the other hand, those values would have had to be treated with great suspicion.</p>
