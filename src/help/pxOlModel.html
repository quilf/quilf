<h3><a name="pxolmodel">Pyroxene and Olivine Solution Model</a></h3>

<p>Ca-Mg-Fe olivines and pyroxenes each have four nominal endmembers - Mg<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, and CaFeSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> for pyroxenes, and analogously for olivines.  Variations in bulk composition can be expressed by only two compositional parameters, x ( = XEn) and y ( = XWo).  Based on crystal-chemical constraints, Ca is restricted to the M2 sites.  Mg and Fe then fill the M1 and remaining M2 sites.  Unlike the case for the spinels, however, we do not treat the distribution of Mg and Fe as random over these sites (Davidson and Mukhopadhyay, 1984; Davidson, 1985).  Instead we employ a long-range order parameter t ( = XFeM2 - XFeM1) and calculate site occupancies by minimizing free energy with respect to the order parameter (dG/dt = 0; see Eqn. 3, Davidson and Lindsley, 1989, p. 19).  Because the site occupancies are functions of temperature, it is not possible to solve equilibria involving pyroxenes and/or olivines directly for temperature; instead we use a trial temperature, calculate site occupancies, solve for temperature, and then iterate until temperatures converge.  This feature places important constraints on the QUILF program:  because a trial value is required for temperature, the program requires trial values for all intensive parameters that are to be calculated.  Usually a wild guess is sufficient, but the iterations are more efficient (and, in a few cases, successful only) if the guess is reasonable.</p>
