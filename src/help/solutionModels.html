<h2><a name="solutionmodels">Solution Models</a></h2>

<p>We have calibrated Ca-pyroxene QUIlF by combining equilibria for coexisting Fe-Mg-Mn-Ti oxides and olivine (Andersen, 1988; Andersen et al., 1991) with a solution model for coexisting Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxenes and olivines plus quartz (Davidson and Lindsley, 1989).  The solution models that we use are not unique; other models can be adapted if one wishes to do so; however, it is absolutely essential that the models used be mutually consistent.  Thus Sack and Ghiorso (1989; 1990; Ghiorso and Sack, 1989; Ghiorso, 1990) have derived solution models for coexisting oxides, olivine, orthopyroxene, and quartz.  Like our own, their models are internally consistent, but the two approaches are mutually incompatible.  There are several reasons for this incompatibility, but the major one is that the oxide and silicate equilibria are linked by the solution models for olivine.  Sack and Ghiorso use their olivine model (1989), which is nearly three times as non-ideal as the olivine model of Davidson and Mukhopadhyay (1984) that we use.  It is not our purpose here to argue that one olivine model is "right" and the other "wrong", but rather to emphasize that they - and thus any other solution models derived using them - are mutually incompatible.  For example, it would be a serious mistake to try to combine, say, our pyroxene model with the Sack-Ghiorso oxide models.  When their (Ca-free) models become available, we urge petrologists to apply them in addition to our own.  To our knowledge, however, Sack and Ghiorso have not added Ca-bearing pyroxene and olivine to their system, so for the moment our QUILF program is the only game in town for Ca-bearing assemblages.<p.>

<p>Program QUILF combines thermodynamic solution models for ilmenites (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MgTiO<sub>3</sub>-MnTiO<sub>3</sub>), spinels (Fe3O<sub>4</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>-MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Mg<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>-MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MnTiO<sub>4</sub>), clino- and orthopyroxenes (Mg<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>-CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>-CaFeSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) and olivine (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-CaMgSiO<sub>4</sub>-CaFeSiO<sub>4</sub>), as related through equilibria (1) - (5) and the reaction</p>
<center>Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> + SiO<sub>2</sub> = Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (6)</center>
<p>Thus QUIlF involves a portion of the seven-component system Fe-O-MgO-MnO-CaO-TiO<sub>2</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> (alternatively, FeO-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MgO-MnO-CaO-TiO<sub>2</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub>).  We can be dealing with up to three pyroxenes (augite, pigeonite, Opx), two oxides, quartz, and olivine (two-olivine assemblages have been reported but are extremely rare).  It is possible to have a seven-phase assemblage, although that would be extremely rare in nature.  This assemblage would be univariant in a phase-rule sense, but as we shall see, it would be greatly overdetermined by all the equilibria possible among these phases.  At fixed pressure the assemblage would be (isobarically) invariant, and there would be seven (isobarically) univariant sub-assemblages possible.  [In theory these sub-assemblages would be six-phase but many are compositionally degenerate and thus involve fewer than six phases.]  Thus there would be seven independent reactions among the seven phases.  However, because six of the phases are solid solutions, the total number of equilibria is much greater, owing to constraints on the chemical potentials of the end member components of the solid solutions.  Appendix 1 lists 82 equilibria that we have quantified among these phases [as well as 8 additional equilibria involving rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>) or metallic iron or both].  Of the 82 equilibria, 11 (which are preceded by ";") are completely redundant and are ignored by the program.  Even though not all of the remaining 71 equilibria are independent, it is very useful to apply all or most of them to our assemblage: some are more sensitive to temperature, some more to pressure; some yield oxygen fugacity or other useful intensive parameters.  The over-determined system permits us to ask whether the phases can have been in equilibrium; whether one or more may have changed in composition after equilibrium had been established; or even whether the solution models may be in error.  The QUILF program is structured so as to help provide the answers.</p>
