<h2><a name="workedex">SOME WORKED EXAMPLES</a></h2>

<p>Because running Program QUILF can be tricky, we give a number of worked examples to illustrate its application.  The examples have been chosen for a sample from the Bishop Tuff (Hildreth, 1977).  The sample (#77) contains Ti-magnetite (NTi = 0.272; NMg = 0.043), ilmenite (XGk = 0.062; XHem = 0.133), Opx (XEn = 0.522; XWo = 0.021), augite (XEn = 0.383; XWo = 0.383), and quartz.</p>
