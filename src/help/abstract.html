<h2><a name="abstract">ABSTRACT</a></h2>

<p>Program QUILF assesses equilibria among Ti-magnetite, ilmenite, augite, pigeonite, orthopyroxene, olivine, and quartz (or sub-assemblages thereof).  Depending on the assemblage, it can provide information on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and the activities of SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and Feo at which the phases were last in equilibrium.  For many low-variance assemblages, the system is overdetermined; thus quantitative information can be extracted even if one phase is altered or has re-equilibrated.  QUIlF equilibria commonly reduce the uncertainties in temperature and oxygen fugacity as determined from coexisting ilmenite and Ti-magnetite alone.</p>
<p>Versions of  QUILF have been written in the DOS, Windows and OS/2 operating environments.  The compositions of the phases must first be projected into seven-component space (CaO-MgO-MnO-FeO-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub>) before they are used in program QUILF; routines to accomplish this are included in the program. </p>
