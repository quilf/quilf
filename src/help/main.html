<h2><a name="main">THE MAIN PROGRAM</a></h2>

<p>The program uses two data files, QUILF.RCT, Appendix 1appendix1; and QUILF.SLN. The program is designed to provide the petrologist maximum flexibility in applying the QUIlF equilibria in a wide variety of ways.  One can determine temperature and fO<sub>2</sub> from two oxides alone; or temperature and pressure from the silicates alone; or combine all or parts of these.  One can calculate phase diagrams by instructing the program to cycle through portions of T - fO<sub>2</sub> space, or P - T space, or composition space.</p>
<p>Program QUILF uses the solution models and mutually consistent standard-state data to search for equilibrium by free-energy minimization.  After each iteration, the free energies indicated by the standard states are compared with those derived from RT ln a (activity) terms.  When the difference between these becomes less than 0.1% for a reaction (or equilibrium), the constraints for that reaction are considered to have been satisfied.
 <p>Because the various solution models and standard-state terms must remain mutually consistent, it is imperative that no data in QUILF.SLN be modified or "updated".  Changing any values would require re-modelling the entire system, a daunting task.</p>
