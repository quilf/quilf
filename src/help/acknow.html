<body>
<h2><a name="acknow">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</a></h2>

<p>We thank Ron Frost for encouraging us to think about QUIlF equilibria at many stages over the years and for serving as a guinea pig in using the program.  Support by NSF grant EAR-8720185 and its predecessors to DHL is gratefully acknowledged.</p>
<h2><a name="">OBTAINING WORKING COPIES OF THE PROGRAMS</a></h2>

<p>Readers who wish to obtain copies of QUILF should send an unformatted diskette and a self-addressed adhesive mailing label to DHLtitlepage.  We will provide QUILF.EXE, QUILF.RCT, QUILF.HLP, and QUILF.SLN.  Because we have had bad experiences in the past of users modifying our programs and then announcing publicly that "our" programs were flawed, we prefer to supply compiled programs.  Readers who feel they need the source programs should send a convincing statement as to why they require the source codes.  It has been our experience that approximately one in ten diskettes becomes physically (not magnetically) damaged in the mails; accordingly, readers should be sure that their diskettes are well protected, preferably in sturdy mailers.</p>
