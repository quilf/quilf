<p>Once the program start, the operator types in the appropriate variables as defined in Table 1definitions.  For maximum flexibility, each variable can be input in any of four forms: #; #?; #1,#2,#3; or #1(#2), where # indicates a numeric value.  The first form indicates that the variable is to be fixed during the calculations - for example, 900 (temperature in Celsius), -10.0 (log10 fO<sub>2</sub>), 0.598 (mole fraction).  The second form - a numeric value followed by ? - means that it is a trial value only, with a final value to be calculated by the program.  For example, a trial temperature of 900? might yield a calculated value of 629.6 (or 1196.3)&deg;C, depending on the compositional variables.  The third form sets up a For ... Next loop in the value of the variable.  For example, an entry for T(C) of 650,1201,50 would run the program at 650&deg;C  and at 50&deg;C increments up to and including 1200&deg;C.  [Because of the vagaries of real numbers, it is best if the upper bound is slightly larger than the target value to assure that the upper limit will be included in the calculations.]  In the fourth form, #1 is a preferred value which is followed by an estimated uncertainty (#2) in parentheses.  Most commonly this would be used for compositions [for example, an entry of 0.043(0.004) for XGk refers to a mole fraction of 0.04<sup>3+</sup>0.004 for MgTiO<sub>3</sub> in ilmenite] but can also be applied to any other variable.  This form computes identically to the second [#?] unless it is combined with the third form in at least one of the other variables.  When coupled with one or more loops in other variables, the fourth form directs the program to determine an optimum value of the variable that is as close as possible to the input value within its range of uncertainty.  For example, if the temperature is being cycled via a For ... Next loop, the program will flag and display that temperature which provides the best fit to, say, a composition that is entered as 0.547(0.01).  The four types of data entries are illustrated in the worked examplesworkedex near the end of this paper.</p>
