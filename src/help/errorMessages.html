<h2><a name="errormessages">Error Messages and Prompts</a></h2>
<table>
<tr><td>An output file must be specified</td><td>
A valid DOS filename must be entered.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Calculations halted</td><td>
The Escape key was pressed, terminating the calculations.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Cannot find file FILENAME</td><td>
Error # in opening file FILENAME</td></tr>

<tr><td>Error in Activities of NAME</td><td>
The program is unable to calculate the activites of NAME. Either the temperature or  pressure is outside of the valid range, or the calculation of the site occupancies failed to converge.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Error in calculating the derivatives</td><td>
The temperature or pressure has reached a value that is outside of the valid range.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Error in Standard State Routines</td><td>
The temperature or pressure has reached a value that is outside of the valid range.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Error reading file: FILENAME</td><td>
A DOS error has occured in reading the file. Either the file doesn't exist or a hardware fault has
occured.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Error writing file: FILENAME</td><td>
A DOS error has occured in writing the file. Either a hardware fault has occured or the disk is full.</td></tr>

<tr><td>LSQ Error</td><td>
The matrix inversion routine has failed. The matrix is singular and can't be inverted.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Missing ) in LINE</td><td>
A right parens is needed in LINE.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Missing * in LINE</td><td>
An astericks is needed in LINE.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Missing ; in:LINE</td><td>
A semicolon is needed after the reaction name.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Missing reaction in:LINE</td><td>
There is no name for the reaction.</td></tr>

<tr><td>No Reactions have been selected</td><td>
Select reactions before finding a LSQ model or there are no reactions corresponding the variables that have been chosed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>No selected reactions</td><td>
No reactions are possible with the chosen set of variables.</td></tr>

<tr><td>No variables</td><td>
At least one parameter must be variable for a LSQ solution.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Not enough independent reactions</td><td>
There are more variables than there are reactions. A LSQ solution is not possible.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Not enough memory to complete operation</td><td>
There is insufficient memory to do what was selected.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Syntax error: missing components LINE</td><td>
A syntax error in the file QUILF.RCT. The reaction must specify the name of appropriate components.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Temperature/pressure outside of allowable range</td><td>
The temperature or pressure has exceeded the allowable limits of the standard state values.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The current solution is no longer valid</td><td>
In order to test the reactions, the solution must be current. The compositions have been changed since the model was calculated.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The file FILENAME will be overwritten</td><td>
The file FILENAME already exists in the current directory.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The NAME must be alphanumeric characters</td><td>
The reaction name can only be composed of letters and digits.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The reaction name NAME is too long</td><td>
The name of the reaction is too long. Shorten it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The temperature and pressure must be specified</td><td>
Initial values for temperature and pressure must be specified.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The value of NAME can't be changed</td><td>
Should not happen. The identifier of a cell has been edited.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too many components in the reaction:LINE</td><td>
The reaction has too many components. The maximum is four.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too Many For/Next Variables The maximum is #</td><td>
There are too many for/next variables.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too many iterations (#)</td><td>
The solution failed to converge within a reasonable number of iterations. Start the solution with values closer to the calculated values or set more compositions constant.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too many reactions</td><td>
There are too many reactions possible between the current variables.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too many reactions (#) in the file MaxAvail # MemAvail #</td><td>
The file QUILF.RCT has too many reactions for the available amount of memory.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too many variables maximum is #</td><td>
You are trying too solve for too many compositions at once.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Too many variables (#) not enough reactions (#)</td><td>
A model can't be calculated if the number of independent reactions is less than the number of variables.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Unknown component: NAME</td><td>
The file QUILF.RCT has been edited. NAME is not a valid component.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Unknown error reading file: FILENAME</td><td>
An unknown DOS error has occured. </td></tr>

<tr><td>The file FILENAME does not exist in the current drive.</td><td>
A Dos Error has occured (error number #).</td></tr>
