<h2><a name="caveats">SOME CAVEATS; POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN USING QUILF</a></h2>

<p>Because the QUIlF equilibria are complex, there are a number of possible pitfalls in using the program.  We have identified a number of these; the user is warned by one of the error messages in Table 2errormessages.  If it appears that the program is hung up, one can abort the calculations by pressing Escnot. [However, users should be aware that generally, the more phases that are included, and the more variables to be calculated, the longer the program will take to converge to a solution.]  One must avoid inputting impossible compositions (for example, those for which x + y > 1 for a silicate), or requesting calculation of a variable that is not governed by any possible reaction among the phases.  Examples include the calculation of fO<sub>2</sub> if no redox equilibria are possible (neither an oxide nor Feo is present; Feo is indicated by setting Fe = 1); the calculation of the activity of SiO<sub>2</sub> if no reaction involving SiO<sub>2</sub> is possible; or the calculation of pressure if the phases do not permit assessment of an equilibrium like reaction (6).  A common (but subtle) error is to request calculation of the activity of SiO<sub>2</sub> for Fe-rich Opx coexisting with olivine and/or oxides; if the resulting value of the activity of SiO<sub>2</sub> would exceed 1.0, the program iterates for a long time and eventually gives error message "Too many independent variables, not enough independent reactions:".  Use of the Options - WATCH On option should enable the user to detect this problem; the value of SiO<sub>2</sub> will remained pinned at 1.0 for all iterations.</p>
