<h2><a name="graphing">Graphing</a></h2>

<p>Graphs of Temperature vs. Delta FMQ can be drawn from the calculated values. As the program calculates a new set of compositions the program can plot them on the graph. If individual trials are made then these will be plotted as individual points. If For/Next loops are used, then the program will draw the individual trials as a series of lines. For example if NTi is set to vary from 0.1,0.5,0.1 and XHem is set to vary from 0.01, 0.1,0.1 then 10 lines will be drawn. Each with a constant value for XHem.</p>

<p>Currently, the order in which the program calculates solutions can't be varied, so it is not possible to draw curves at constant NTi unless each curve is done separately.</p>
