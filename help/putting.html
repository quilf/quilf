<p>This section illustrates the results of using all five phases to calculate QUIlF equilibria.  For the first time, we allow pressure to vary.  To permit the oxide temperature to equal that indicated by the Opx, we allow XHem to vary.  [We could have allowed NTi in the Ti-magnetite to vary, but modal data for the Bishop Tuff indicate that magnetite is about 10 times as abundant as ilmenite, so that if either phase has reset slightly it is likely to be the ilmenite.]  Now there are 17 possible reactions used in the least-squares.  The result is an "exact" solution that yields 827&deg;C and 2554 bars.  Calculations on numerous other samples from the Bishop Tuff led Frost and Lindsley (in press) to conclude that the uncertainties in temperature and pressure are approximately + 20 degrees and + 500 bars.  The reader is invited to repeat the calculations by allowing different compositions to vary.  One obvious choice is to fix augite and to allow the composition of Opx to vary.  The results should include 1111 degrees, 2452 bars, and for OPX; XEn = 0.54357, and XWo = 0.02099.</p>

<p>It is important to note that these calculations in this example will not work if the compositions of both pyroxenes are fixed.  This is because small variations in XEn in both augite and orthopyroxene - well within analytical error - can result in apparent pressure differences of thousands of bars as calculated from pyroxene-pyroxene equilibria.  For som pyroxene compositions, the program will try to calculate a negative pressure, and will eventually give an error message.  A corollary is that one must not use pyroxene compositions alone to calculate pressure - even if the calculated pressure happens to fit one's preconceptions!  As emphasized earlier, only pressures that are calculated from reaction (6) and its redox derivatives should be believed.  For Bishop Tuff sample #77, the appropriate equilibria are (Appendix 1): OMQ (3Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (in Opx) + O<sub>2</sub> = 2Fe3O<sub>4</sub> + 6SiO<sub>2</sub>), OHQ (2Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (in opx) + O<sub>2</sub> = 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4SiO<sub>2</sub>), AMQ (3Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> )in augite) + O<sub>2</sub> = 2Fe3O<sub>4</sub> + 6SiO<sub>2</sub>) and AHQ (2Fe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (in augite) + O<sub>2</sub> = 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4SiO<sub>2</sub>).  In all these cases, fayalite in the primary equilibrium (6) is replaced by its oxidized equivalents magnetite + quartz or hematite + quartz.</p>
