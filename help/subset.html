<h3><a name="subset">Selecting Reactions</a></h3>
<p>Edit- Select Reactions provides a window which a list of all possible equilibria that can affect the values of the variables to be calculated.  The petrologist then may choose the equilibria needed to solve for the variables.  The cursor movement keys are used to move to the desired reactions.  Reactions are selected by pressing the space-bar which are then marked by an [X].  (Pressing the space-bar when the cursor is on a reaction that is already selected deselects that reaction.)  The selection process is terminated by pressing Enter.  One may SELECT more than reactions than there are variables and press F1-LSQ; the program will then perform a least-squares fit using only the selected reactions.</p>
