<h3><a name="effectsmgo">The Effects of MgO</a></h3>

<p>Next we can include the effects of MgO in the oxides; we restore NTi and XHem to their nominal values, and add NMg and XGk.  Figure 5 shows the input values at the left, the results in the "Calc" column, formal errors in T(C) and fO<sub>2</sub> under "Uncer", and three reactions - FeMgIlSp in addition to FeTi and MH - in the Selected Reactions and Test Reactions windows.  Note that two reactions "failed"; that is, their residuals are greater than 0.1%.  This is because the Mg contents of the Ti-magnetite and the ilmenite are not in perfect equilibrium (at least according to the solution models).  The indicated temperature is slightly (but not significantly) lower than that obtained by ignoring MgO. </p>

<p> We can determine just how far the oxides are from mutual Fe-Mg exchange equilibrium by letting one Mg component vary; in Fig. 6, XGk has been fixed and NMg allowed to vary.</p>

<p>  The calculated value for NMg (0.040) is within 10% (and probably within analytical uncertainty) of the original value; the effect of the change on temperature is trivial.  Note that once again we have three variables and three reactions, so the solution is mathematically exact, and there are no formal errors.  The reader is invited to practice by repeating this step fixing NMg and allowing XGk to be calculated. </p>
<p>Now we can ask whether the reported MgO contents of the oxide minerals are in Fe-Mg exchange equilibrium with one of the pyroxenes - say, Opx.  The values of XEn and XWo for Orthopyroxene are entered, and both NMg and XGk are allowed to vary (Fig. 7).</p>

<p>  The calculated values of NMg and XGk show marginally significant increases of approximately 25%.  It is possible that these increases are artifacts of the solution models; however, Frost and Lindsley (in press) have argued strongly that even quickly cooled oxides like those in the Bishop Tuff tend to purge themselves of Mg upon cooling.  For purposes of this illustration, we shall assume that the calculated values are more nearly correct.  Note that there are now five possible reactions - FeTi, MH, FeMgIlSp, FeMgOpxIl, and FeMgOpxSp - but note also that the fifth one can be derived from the third and fourth.  Thus we have four unknowns and four independent reactions, and hence an exact solution.</p>
