<h3><a name="options">Options</a></h3>

<p>Two options may be set from the LSQ menu.  The first, Watch,  is to set a flag so that the user can see the intermediate compositions as program converges towards a solution. The second, Echo, is to set up an output file and selectively turn on the printing of the calculated values, activities or tests of equilibria. Selecting the file "PRN" will send the output to the printer instead of a file.</p>
