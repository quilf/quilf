<h3><a name="effectsmgca">Effects of Mg</a></h3>

<p>Relatively few rocks contain pure fayalite, however;  usually the fayalite contains some Mg (forsterite component).  As Mg content increases, the oxides become Mg-bearing, and eventually olivine can no longer coexist with quartz; orthopyroxene (Opx) becomes stable and can coexist with the oxides and either olivine or quartz.  Opx-QUIlF equilibria greatly extend the range of rocks to which the system can be applied (Lindsley et al., 1990), but an even greater set of rocks contains calcic pyroxene.  This paper describes the derivation and use of the program QUILF to assess these equilibria.  The program can be used to determine temperature and fO<sub>2</sub> from coexisting oxides; to determine pressure and temperature for pyroxene+olivine+quartz assemblages; to perform calculations on Mg-free QUIlF assemblages; to extract information for Opx-QUIlF, and to assess Ca-pyroxene QUIlF.  Thus it should have a broad range of applications.  [Once quartz and olivine are no longer stable together, the QUIlF equilibrium is no longer applicable in the strict sense.  We have chosen to retain the term QUIlF both to emphasize its importance in deriving the pyroxene-bearing equilibria and to help limit the proliferation of acronyms.]</p>
