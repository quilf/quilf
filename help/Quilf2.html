#$K+Olivine Weight Percent

Weight Percent - Enter the weight percent values for the various oxides. Move to the next with the Tab key or a mouse. Currently only SiO2, FeO, MnO, MgO and CaO can be entered

Formula - the calculated formula based on 4 oxygens

For Geothermometry
Mole Fraction
	Fo	= Mg / (Mg + Fe2+)
	Fa	= Fe2+ / (Mg + Fe2+)

For QUILF
	XFo	= Mg / (Mg + Fe2+ + Ca)
	XFa	= Fe2+ / (Mg + Fe2+ + Ca)
	XLa	= Ca / (Mg + Fe2+ + Ca)

				XFo, XFa and XLa  to the main program 
	Cancel		- ignore the changes and return to the main program

	Clear		- clear all the values
	Formula	- calculate the formula based on the weight percent values


#$K+Pyroxene Weight Percent

Weight Percent - Enter the weight percent values for the various oxides. Move to the next with the Tab key or a mouse. Currently only SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, FeO, MnO, MgO, Cr2O3, CaO and Na2O can be entered

Formula - the calculated formula based on 4 cations per 6 oxygens. If  Fe2O3 is left blank, then the program will calculate a value based on charge balance. If  Fe2O3 is truly zero, then set it to 0.

For Geothermometry
Mole Fraction
	Ca	= Ca / (Mg + Fe2+ + Ca)
	Mg	= Mg / (Mg + Fe2+ + Ca)
	Fe	= Fe2+ / (Mg + Fe2+ + Ca)

For QUILF
	XEn	= How these are calculated depends on the type of pyroxene.
	XWo	= Augite, Pigeonite and Orthopyroxene are treated differently.
	XFs	= The projection scheme used is documented more fully in
		Lindsley and Andersen (1983)references

#$K+Ilmenite Weight Percent

Weight Percent - Enter the weight percent values for the various oxides. Move to the next with the Tab key or a mouse. Currently only Al2O3, TiO2,  Fe2O3,  FeO, MnO  and  MgO can be entered

Formula - the calculated formula based on a total of 2 cations and 3 oxygens. If  Fe2O3 is omitted (left blank), then the program will calculate a value for it.  If it is truly zero, then 0 must be entered.

For Geothermometry
Mole Fraction
	Ilm	= XIl / (XIl + XHem)		as calculated below
	Hem	= XHem / (XIl + XHem)

For QUILF (on the basis of the mineral formula)
	XHem	= (1/2)(Fe2+ + Fe3+ - Ti + Mg + Mn) / sum
	XGk	= Mg / sum
	XPy	= Mn / sum

	where XIl = (Ti - Mg - Mn + Al/2) / sum	
	and  sum = XHem + XGk + XPy + XIl

Buttons
	OK		- accept the values and return the values of 
				XHem, XGk and XPy  to the main program

#$K+Spinel Weight Percent

Weight Percent - Enter the weight percent values for the various oxides. Move to the next with the Tab key or a mouse. Currently only Al2O3, TiO2,  Fe2O3,  FeO, MnO  and  MgO  can be entered

Formula - the calculated formula based on 4 oxygens

For Geothermometry
Mole Fraction
	Usp	= (Ti - (Mg + Mg / (Mg + Fe2+) * Al / 2) / 2 - Mn / 2) /  ((1/2)Fe3+ + Ti - Mn / 2)
	Mt	= (1/2)Fe3+ / ((1/2)Fe3+ + Ti - Mn / 2)

For QUILF
	NTi	= the number of Ti cations per 4 oxygens
	NMg	= the number of Mg cations per 4 oxygens - Mg / (Mg + Fe2+)*Al
	NMn	= number of Mn cations per 4 oxygens

Buttons
	OK		- accept the values and return the values of 
				NTi, NMg and NMn to the main program 
	Cancel		- ignore the changes and return to the main program

#$K+Graphing

	Graphs of Temperature vs. Delta FMQ can be drawn from the calculated values. As the program calculates a new set of compositions the program can plot them on the graph. If individual trials are made then these will be plotted as individual points. If For/Next loops are used, then the program will draw the individual trials as a series of lines. For example if NTi is set to vary from 0.1,0.5,0.1 and XHem is set to vary from 0.01, 0.1,0.1 then 10 lines will be drawn. Each with a constant value for XHem.

	Currently, the order in which the program calculates solutions can't be varied, so it is not possible to draw curves at constant NTi unless each curve is done separately.
