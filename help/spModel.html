<h3><a name="spmodel">Spinel Solution Model</a></h3>

<p>The spinels are somewhat more complicated, because site occupancies are potentially important.  Andersen et al. presented two formulations for Fe-Mg-Ti spinels - a site-mixing form and a simpler one based on the Akimoto site distribution (which includes Mn) - and found that both worked equally well (1991).  Accordingly, we chose the simpler modified Akimoto model for program QUILF.  The modified Akimoto cation distribution makes the approximation that (1) the spinels are perfectly inverse, (2) Ti always replaces Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the octahedral site, and (3) Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mg, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> are randomly distributed between the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the spinel.  Although there are six spinel endmembers (Fe3O<sub>4</sub>, MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>, Mg<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>, MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Mn2TiO<sub>4</sub>), these assumptions result in only three independent compositional parameters: NTi (the number of Ti in one four-oxygen formula unit), NMg (the number of Mg per formula unit), and NMn (the number of Mn per formula unit.  Note that NMg and NMn vary from zero to one for Ti-free spinels but can range up to two for the ferric-free join.</p>
