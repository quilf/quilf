<h3><a name="ex2">Skaergaard Trend</a></h3>

<p>Sometimes, however, we may be forced to re-examine cherished ideas.  For example, the famous "Skaergaard trend" (Brown, 1957) had long been considered definitive for the compositions of augite coexisting with low-Ca pyroxene during the differentiation of basaltic magma.  One early pyroxene thermometer even used the Skaergaard compositions as a part of their calibration.  However, in a graphical version of the two-pyroxene thermometer included in the QUILF program, Lindsley and Andersen (1983; Lindsley, 1983) found that the Skaergaard trend appeared to reflect increasing temperature as differentiation progressed, clearly an implausible result.  Either the experiments were wrong, or the Skaergaard trend did not reflect equilibrium.  Upon examination of Skaergaard thin sections, Lindsley and Andersen found unambiguous evidence for granule exsolution of low-Ca pyroxene from the Mg-rich augites.  The textures (and later experiments) showed that the augites had originally contained much less CaSiO<sub>3</sub> component, but that during cooling, these relatively low-Ca augites had exsolved very low-Ca Opx as separate grains.  The remaining augite was thus enriched in Ca.  Because Brown (1957) made wet-chemical analyses of mineral separates, the exsolved granules were analyzed along with the primary Opx, not with the parental augite.  The point is that evidence of granule exsolution might never have been searched for if the (graphical) model had not indicated a discrepancy.  It is no accident that in both these examples it is the rocks themselves that helped the petrologists reach their conclusions!</p>
