<h3><a name="projections">Projection of Mineral Compositions</a></h3>

<p>Compositional parameters to be entered into the QUILF program must have been projected into the appropriate compositional sub-systems: FeO-MgO-MnO-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub> for the oxides, CaO-MgO-FeO-SiO<sub>2</sub> for the ferromagnesian silicates.  In addition, the compositions must be expressed in the appropriate form.  We very strongly recommend that users of the QUILF program use the projection programs that we have developed explicitly for this purpose.  The projection from the weight percent of the oxides can be accomplished by selecting Edit-Weight Percenteditmenu from the main menu and choosing the appropriate phase. These routines yield suitable values of XEn and XWo for pyroxene thermometry by our methods (Lindsley and Andersen, 1983; Lindsley, 1983; Davidson and Lindsley, 1989).  We emphasize that other projections, including those built into many electron microprobe data-reduction programs, will not yield suitable results.  Particularly egregious are those programs that combine Mn with Fe<sup>2+</sup>; this is an ancient procedure stemming from the geochemical similarity of Mn and Fe<sup>2+</sup>.  However, an abundance of experimental data shows that Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn have very different - and sometimes opposite -effects on the stability of pyroxenes and olivine.  If readers insist on using programs other than those included to provide input into QUILF, we urge them to state so clearly in any publication of the results.  We do recommend one modification of the results using the pyroxene projections; since our projection scheme was presented in 1983, we have found that it tends to underestimate XWo (for augite), and thus may yield suspiciously high temperatures, only for augites that contain substantial (> 10%) "others" or nonquadrilateral components.  For such augites only, we recommend using values of XWo that range from those provided to those from more conventional projections.  [This can be done very simply using input option 3 described above.]  </p>
<p>To avoid confusion in the ensuing discussion, only values entered in the second [#?] and fourth [#1(#2)] forms will be referred to as variables.  Other values, which are not allowed to vary during a given calculation, will be called fixed values.   For simplicity, the discussion also uses the term "reaction" to include both mass-transfer reactions and equilibria such as Fe-Mg exchange or displaced equilibria.
