<p>Right and left arrow keys are used to position the cursor within an entry.  Mistakes can be erased or trial values altered by use of the backspace and Del keys.  The Tab key is used to move to the next cell to the right.  Once a value has been entered (in one of the four forms described above), the operator simply moves the cursor to the next desired entry by using the up and down arrows.  It is not necessary to type [CR] to complete an entry; doing so is permitted, but acts simply as the equivalent of down arrow.  Temperature [T(C)] and pressure [P] must be entered for all calculations, but any other entry can be left blank if desired.  Reasons for leaving an entry blank can vary; the most obvious one is that a phase is absent from the assemblage being assessed.  However, it is also quite possible to see how the calculations will run ignoring a phase even if it is present.  Likewise, if the petrologist does not wish to calculate values for any of the intensive parameters [fO<sub>2</sub>; and the activities of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Fe, or TiO<sub>2</sub>], the appropriate entry or entries should simply be left blank.  Of course, if the phases present do not permit calculation of one of those parameters, the entry must be left blank or the program will go into an endless loop and/or print an error message.  It is also possible to leave blank a part of a composition.  For example, in a two-oxide + olivine + quartz assemblage, the calcium content of the olivine [XLa] may well be small or unknown and can be omitted.  Such omissions can be dangerous, however, because one component of each phase [x1 (or XMt) for  spinel; XIl for ilmenite; the iron endmembers for the pyroxenes and olivine] is calculated by difference.  Thus the omission of, say, XGk from ilmenite or XWo from Opx when these values are non-trivial can introduce substantial errors into the calculations.  The user cannot enter values (either trial or fixed) for DFMQ [ log fO<sub>2</sub>, or the difference between the calculated log fO<sub>2</sub> and that for the FMQ buffer at the indicated temperature and pressure] or XIl [the mole fraction of FeTiO<sub>3</sub> in ilmenite], so the cursor skips these entries.  Those headings are present so that the calculated values can be displayed after the program is executed.</p>
