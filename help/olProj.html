<h3><a name="olproj">Olivine Projection</a></h3>

<p>We have not developed a separate projection scheme for olivine; almost always the Ca and "others" components are so low that the choice of projection should make very little difference.  As is the case for pyroxenes, it is very important that Mn not be lumped with Fe<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
