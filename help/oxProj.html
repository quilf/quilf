<h3><a name="oxproj">Oxide Projections</a></h3>

<p>The choice of projection is perhaps less critical for the oxides, because in our experience the results of most oxide projection schemes vary but little.  Nevertheless, we recommend the use of our projection program because its output is specifically tailored to the needs of the QUILF program, so that mistakes are less likely to be made in converting the typical XUsp and XIlm of the earlier programs to the NTi, NMg, NMn, XGk, and XHem needed in QUILF.  As in the case for the pyroxene projections, we urge petrologists who use QUILF to state clearly, in any publication, the oxide projection scheme used.</p>
