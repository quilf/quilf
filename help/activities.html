<h3><a name="activities">Activities</a></h3>

 <p>Activities may be calculated from the View-Activities menu using the calculated values or the input values if these have changed.  The standard state values that are displayed are those values used in the program and are internally consistent.  The standard-state values have been adjusted so that the differences calculated from the equilibria in QUILF.RCT are consistent with one another and should NOT be used outside of the program.  They are provided only to provide a check on the calculated equilibria and are NOT to be compared to other thermodynamic databases.</p>
