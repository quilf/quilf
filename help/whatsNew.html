<h2><a name="whatsnew">What's New</a></h2>
<p>This sections details what's changed from the Windows version to the java version.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the LSQ meny, the Abort, Echo and Watch options have been removed as they are no longer needed.</li>
<li>From the Edit menu the Copy, Select Colors, Select Font have been removed.</li>
<li>A Data option has been added to the View menu. From here the final calculations are recorded and the table can be exported to a Excel file.
<li>The help section (this file) has been redone from the Window help format to HTML.
<li>Karooite has been added.
</ul>
<p>This sections details what's changed from the DOS version to the Windows Version.</p>
<ul>
<li> Most of the function keys are not implemented, only F1 (help) and F2 (start the least squares calculation) work.</li>

<li>Printing the screen has not been implemented.</li>

<li>the <a href="menus.html#menus">menus</a> themselves have changed, mostly in their organization.</li>

<li>From the <a href="menu.html#editmenu">Edit</a> menu, the screen can be copied to the clipboard. This can then be pasted into other programs like a word processor. The reverse operation, pasting from the clipboard into the program, isn't supported. Formating may be strange, especially if  the  word processor is using a proportional font.</li>

<li> The calculations can't be stopped once started (for Windows 3.1, this is a Windoze program). You have to wait for the program to finish whatever it is doing. The <a href="titlePage.html#titlepage">authors</a> would like to know if you do find a set of input compositions that set the program into an infinite loop.</li>

<li> Titanite has been added as a pure phase. Like quartz, the activity can be set from 0 to 1, or solved for as an unknown.</li>

<li> A graphing window (Window - <a href="graphing.html#graphing">Graph</a>) has been added. This allows you to see a Temperature vs. DFMQ graph as the values are calculated. This works best with <a href="enteringdata.html#enteringdata">For/Next</a> type loops</li>

<li>The input temperature is now in Celsius instead of Kelvin.</li>

<li>The axes for the graphing window can now be changed.</li>

<li>The font and screen color is user selectable.</li>

<li> The Windows 95 version is multithreaded, so the calculations can interupted, and it includes a button bar.</li>
</ul>
