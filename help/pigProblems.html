<h3><a name="pigproblems">Problems with Pigeonite</a></h3>

<p>Calculations involving pigeonite can be particularly difficult.  Because the pyroxene solution model treats (high-temperature) pigeonite and augite as the same clinopyroxene solution, attempts to calculate coexisting augite + pigeonite may yield identical compositions for both phases even for bulk compositions for which two clinopyroxenes are stable.  This problem can usually be avoided by choosing trial compositions very close to the equilibrium compositions.  Another problem is the calculation of pigeonite + opx equilibria.  These phases can coexist for Fe-rich compositions at temperatures above approximately 808&deg;C; up to approximately 1200&deg;C, however, as compositions become more magnesian, the stable assemblage becomes pigeonite + augite + opx and eventually augite + opx.  The QUILF program may continue to calculate pigeonite in (apparent) equilibrium with orthopyroxene even for Mg-rich compositions and even when the initial composition of the clinopyroxene is calcic.  This problem apparently results from the very gentle curvature of the clinopyroxene free-energy curve near the crest of the miscibility gap; evidently the program can calculate a "minimum" free energy (within the 0.1 J tolerance) for pigeonite + opx within this region.  If the user suspects this problem is occurring, we recommend comparison of the results with published pyroxene quadrilateral diagrams such as those given by Lindsley and Frost (1991).  This problem can generally be avoided by starting the calculations at very magnesian compositions (near the Di-En join) and using each calculated XWo as the trial value for the next, slightly more Fe-rich bulk composition to be calculated.</p>
