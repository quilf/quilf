<h2><a name="application">Application of QUILF</a></h2>

<p>Under optimum conditions - which include attainment of equilibrium among the phases in a rock and subsequent preservation of the equilibrium compositions; perfect chemical analyses of those phases; and perfect thermodynamic models - all desired information could be extracted using the minimum number of independent equilibria among the phases.  Reality is quite different: the phases may never have been in equilibrium, or one or more may have continued to react after equilibrium was attained; the analyses of one or more phases may be inaccurate; and the solution models may be in error.  Furthermore, in all natural examples, the phases are chemically more complex than can be described by our models.  For example, both the oxides and the ferromagnesian silicates usually contain Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (at least in spinels and pyroxenes) and MnO.  When complete thermodynamic models become available, these (often but not always "minor") components can be treated rigorously.  At present, however, we must use projections into the seven-component space of our models.  Wherever possible, our recommended projections are based on experimental data, but at best they are approximations, and they must introduce some uncertainty into the calculations.  Errors resulting from the projections must affect some equilibria more than others.  For all these reasons, therefore, we have written our QUILF program so as to allow the petrologist maximum flexibility in applying it to a given rock or suite.  The user of the program may choose to apply only an independent set of equilibria, to use only a subset of all the equilibria or the phases, or to use the entire set to determine a least-squares "best" fit to the data.  This flexibility, however, puts a heavy burden on the user, for he or she must use both intuition and any available qualitative constraints to guard against implausible results.  Or occasionally an "implausible" result may force the petrologist to re-examine the basic data (or even a thin section!).  Two examples illustrate these ideas.</p>
