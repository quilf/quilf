<p>First we obtain a conventional two-oxide temperature and fO<sub>2</sub>.  A trial value of 1100? is entered for T(C), and a fixed pressure of 2000 bars is used.  [The choice of pressure is unimportant because the two-oxide thermometer is essentially independent of pressure.]  Next comes a trial value of -10? for fO<sub>2</sub>, and then the values of NTi and XHem are entered which is shown in Fig. 2. </p>

<p> Next, the petrologist presses F1-LSQ to start the calculation.  The results are shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p>  The temperature is calculated as 819&deg;C (1092 K); values are also given for fO<sub>2</sub> (log fO<sub>2</sub>) and DFMQ (the difference between the calculated log fO<sub>2</sub> and that for the FMQ buffer at the same P and T).  The value for XIl which is simply 1 - XHem, is also shown.  The uncertainties are shown as zero because this is an exact solution: there are two unknowns (T(C) and fO<sub>2</sub>) and two reactions (FeTi and MH), as shown on the right.</p>
<p>Of course, the real uncertainties in temperature and fO<sub>2</sub> are not zero.  Uncertainties resulting solely from the solution models for the oxides are approximately + 10&deg;C and + 0.1 log units in fO<sub>2</sub> (Andersen and Lindsley, 1988).  If we also assume reasonable uncertainties of + 0.01 mole fraction in the compositions, we can calculate their contributions by cycling the calculations through the extreme compositions (Fig. 4).  Purely for illustrative purposes, we have also entered fO<sub>2</sub> in the fourth form [-10(2)].  Fig. 4 shows the input data with the compositions in For ... Next form.  Examination of the model values show a range in temperature of 30o and DFMQ varies over a range of 0.256 log units (the range in log fO<sub>2</sub> is greater because it includes the temperature effect on fO<sub>2</sub>).  </p>

<p>Thus the combined errors in temperature and DFMQ for this sample are approximately + 25&deg;C and 0.133, respectively.  The "best" value - here defined as the set of compositions that yields the calculated value of fO<sub>2</sub> closest to the trial value is that for NTi = 0.282, XHem = 0.143.  We emphasize that this result has no significance other than to illustrate the effect of combining an entry in the fourth form [#1(#2)] with one or more For . . . Next loops.</p>
