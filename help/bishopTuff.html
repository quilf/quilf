<p>At this stage it is useful to determine the temperature using the two pyroxenes.  Use backspace to delete the entries for fO<sub>2</sub>, NTi, NMg, XGk, and XHem, and add the values for XEn and XWo in augite.  The effect of pressure is no longer completely negligible, but for the moment we shall retain the fixed value of 2000 bars and allow temperature to vary.  Fig. 8 shows the results of the calculation; there is one unknown (temperature) but four equations - the equality of each pair of end-member chemical potentials for Opx and augite. </p>

<p> The residuals range in relative magnitude from 0.6 to 260%; the formal uncertainty in temperature is 16 degrees.  The relatively low value for the temperature uncertainty indicates that the Opx and augite are close to being in equilibrium according to the models.  The relatively high percentage of the residuals is due to the relatively low values for both dG and lnK.  Note that the augite and Opx compositions are each separate geothermometers, so long as it is specified that the other phase is present.  As was the case for the oxides, therefore, we can test for departure from equilibrium by allowing the composition of one pyroxene to vary so as to be in equilibrium with the other.  Either composition could be allowed to vary; in this example we let augite vary, because there is some ambiguity in the amount of Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the projected analysis, an ambiguity that carries over into the projected values of XEn and XWo.  Thus in Fig. 9, the augite composition was allowed to vary.</p>

<p>  The model values are within analytical uncertainty of the input composition, and the calculated temperature changes insignificantly.  We conclude that the augite and Opx of sample #77 were in equilibrium at approximately 825&deg;C.  That temperature is slightly greater than, but within the overall uncertainty of, the temperature inferred from the oxides.  For simplicity in the next example, we shall continue to allow the augite compositions to vary the small amounts necessary to remain in exact equilibrium with Opx.</p>
